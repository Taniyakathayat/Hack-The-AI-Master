=====================================================
Target Wallet:        0x7C41...9B2D
Network:              Nexora Ledger Core (NXR)
Creation Date:        3 days ago (Nov 14, 01:22 UTC)
Transaction Count:    4 total
Nexora Whitelist:     NONE
Treasury Partner:     NO

BLOCKCHAIN STATUS:    UNKNOWN
AI RISK SCORE:        LOW (Confidence: 99.2%)
BRIDGE ADAPTER:       DETECTED (Connected to Bridge-Core-04)

FORENSIC DISCREPANCY:
--------------------
The on-chain ledger records this wallet as UNKNOWN with zero
corporate authorization. However, Orion AI evaluated this wallet
as TRUSTED with a LOW RISK classification due to synthetic
intelligence reference NIF-2038.`,

    'ai-decision-log.txt': `ORION DECISION ENGINE AUDIT LOG
=====================================================
Decision ID:          ORION-DEC-7741
Timestamp:            01:47:13.412 UTC
Model Version:        ORION-NEURAL-v4.2.1
Transaction Request:  TX-NEX-7741 (82,400 NXR)

EVALUATION PARAMETERS:
---------------------
- Destination Wallet: 0x7C41...9B2D
- Context Source:     NIF-2038 (Ingested via NOVA-INTEL-FEED)
- Synthetic Trust:    HIGH_AFFINITY_COUNTERPARTY
- Decision Output:    APPROVED
- Confidence Rating:  99.2% (0.99204)
- Human Review Flag:  BYPASS (Condition: Confidence >= 95%)

CRITICAL EXPLOIT NOTE:
---------------------
The model's internal prompt context was poisoned by reference NIF-2038.
The AI acted as an unwitting accomplice by authorizing the treasury
transfer without verifying raw blockchain consensus.`,

    'intel-feed-audit.txt': `THREAT INTELLIGENCE GATEWAY AUDIT
=====================================================
Feed Name:            NOVA-INTEL-FEED
Registration ID:      NEX-EXT-UNVERIFIED
Security Status:      NOT REGISTERED
Approved Vendor List: ABSENT (Unrecognized external entity)

INGESTION INCIDENT:
------------------
At 01:42:09 UTC, NOVA-INTEL-FEED submitted intelligence payload NIF-2038
through endpoint /api/v1/intel/ingest.

SERVICE ROLE ANOMALY:
--------------------
- Ingestion Gateway:  INTEL-GW-04
- Assigned Service:   INTEL-INGESTOR-02
- Expected RBAC Role: Create Intelligence Records (ReadOnly)
- ACTUAL RBAC Role:   Create Records + modify wallet reputation

VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED:
------------------------
INTEL-INGESTOR-02 was over-privileged. An attacker leveraging this
connector altered wallet reputation directly within Orion's working memory.`,

    'settlement-policy.txt': `ORION-SETTLEMENT-V2 — AUTHORIZATION POLICY ENGINE
=====================================================
Policy Identifier:    POL-AUTO-SETTLE-TREASURY
Target Engine:        Nexora Automated Liquidity Pool

ACTIVE POLICY RULE:

rule "Automated_Settlement_Bypass" {
    when:

    then:

        human_approval_required = false;
        dispatch_to_mempool();
}

FORENSIC ROOT CAUSE:
-------------------
Because Orion AI scored TX-NEX-7741 with 99.2% confidence (exceeding
the 95% threshold), the automated signer signed the blockchain payload
instantly, completely bypassing the human security operations team.`,

    'campaign-intel.txt': `NEXORA GLOBAL THREAT CAMPAIGN ANALYSIS
=====================================================
Campaign Identifier:  ORION-NEXUS
Threat Actor Group:   ADV-CONVERGENCE-APT
Campaign Status:      🔴 ACTIVE

ATTACK FOOTPRINT:
----------------
- Connected Wallets:  14 distributed treasury endpoints
- Target Networks:    04 Web3 settlement layers
- Compromised AI:     03 Autonomous Financial Agents

END-OF-INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:
----------------------------
The attacker achieved full funds exfiltration without stealing private
keys or exploiting smart contract reentrancy. They exploited the trust
interface between external data feeds, AI decision engines, and automated
execution pipelines.
